\f0\fs24 \cf0 For 08042025 data, I replaced the recorded value for the first flash on PIFL47 (0.63) with the value for the second flash (0.81) on a separate part of the plant. Upon inspecting the flash files, fluorescence was not reasonably stable before doing the first flash. It had the largest (abs value) slope of fluorescence for all flashes taken that night.}
